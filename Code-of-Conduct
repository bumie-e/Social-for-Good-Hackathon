# Code of Conduct

The following principles are important values that you agree to abide by as a member of Women in Data Science OAU. If you break the code of conduct, you will be removed from the community.

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as community members and leaders pledge to making participation and involvement with the community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, any one that violates this Code of Conduct, and will take moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within and in outside the community group chats and events when an individual is representing the community. Examples of representing the community include using the community logo and name to promote an event or activity, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. 

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the campus team lead at akinremibunmi111@gmail.com. The team leads will review and investigate all complaints, and will respond in a way that it deems appropriate to the circumstances. The team leads are obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Team leads who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the community leadership.
